@article{Satoh2008,
abstract = {A new type of ultra-high resolution atmospheric global circulation model is developed. The new model is designed to perform "cloud resolving simulations" by directly calculating deep convection and meso-scale circulations, which play key roles not only in the tropical circulations but in the global circulations of the atmosphere. Since cores of deep convection have a few km in horizontal size, they have not directly been resolved by existing atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). In order to drastically enhance horizontal resolution, a new framework of a global atmospheric model is required; we adopted nonhydrostatic governing equations and icosahedral grids to the new model, and call it Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM). In this article, we review governing equations and numerical techniques employed, and present the results from the unique 3.5-km mesh global experiments-with O(109) computational nodes-using realistic topography and land/ocean surface thermal forcing. The results show realistic behaviors of multi-scale convective systems in the tropics, which have not been captured by AGCMs. We also argue future perspective of the roles of the new model in the next generation atmospheric sciences. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Duncan1998,
abstract = {An urban plume model is used to simulate the photochemistry of ozone (O-3) precursors and the concomitant generation of O-3 within an urban plume as it advects and mixes with the background atmosphere. On the basis of these calculations, we estimate the rates at which O-3 and its precursor compounds are exported to the background atmosphere and how these export rates are affected by various control strategies that might be implemented to reduce maximum O-3 concentrations within the urban plume. Two model cities with different chemical characteristics are considered: case 1, where peak O-3 concentrations during extreme air pollution episodes are more sensitive to nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) and case 2, where peak O-3 concentrations during these episodes are more sensitive to volatile organic compounds(VOC). The model is first run for extreme meteorological conditions conducive to the generation of high O-3 concentrations to determine the most effective emission control strategies for reducing peak O-3 under these conditions. The model is then run for more typical meteorological conditions, to determine how these various emission control scenarios might affect the export of O-3 and its precursors from the urban to the rural and background atmosphere. The export of O-3 from the urban atmosphere is found to be more sensitive to NOx emissions, even for case 2 where VOC emission controls more effectively reduced peak O-3 during pollution episodes. The impact of VOC and NOx emission reductions on the export of primary and secondary O-3 precursor compounds is more complex, leading to reductions in the export of some species and enhancements in the export of others.},

@article{Bubnova1995,
abstract = {Abstract ARPEGE/Aladin is a limited-area 3D primitive equation model, which belongs to the integrated NWP ARPEGE/IFS system. Like its global counterpart, the limited-area version has a spectral representation of variables in the horizontal but uses double-Fourier series instead of the classical spherical harmonies, in the manner introduced by Machenhauer and Haugen. Following the suggestion of Laprise, a nonhydrostatic version of ARPEGE/Aladin has been developed using hydrostatic pressure as an independent variable. The dynamics employ the fully elastic Euler equations of motion, orography being introduced via a terrain-following hybrid coordinate. A semi-implicit scheme has been formulated to control both acoustic and gravity waves. The discrete linear operators appear to have the same form as in the hydrostatic dynamics, except an additional one representing the vertical part of the Laplacian operator. To keep an elegant elimination, it was necessary to modify the approximation of logarithmic thicknesse...},

The result$\backslash$nis a myriad of incompatible MPI implementations, all of which require$\backslash$nseparate installation, and the combination of which present significant$\backslash$nlogistical challenges for end users. Building upon prior research,$\backslash$nand influenced by experience gained from the code bases of the LAM/MPI,$\backslash$nLA-MPI, and FT-MPI projects, Open MPI is an all-new, productionquality$\backslash$nMPI-2 implementation that is fundamentally centered around component$\backslash$nconcepts. Open MPI provides a unique combination of novel features$\backslash$npreviously unavailable in an open-source, production-quality implementation$\backslash$nof MPI. Its component architecture provides both a stable platform$\backslash$nfor third-party research as well as enabling the run-time composition$\backslash$nof independent software add-ons. This paper presents a high-level$\backslash$noverview the goals, design, and implementation of Open MPI.},

abstract = {Bott's forward-in-time, positive-definite, area-preserving flux-form advection algorithm is extended to higher orders. The new algorithm versions are tested with two-dimensional flow fields: a purely rotational how and a purely deformational flow. The results suggest that a balance between required accuracy and reasonable computational cost is obtained for schemes with orders of 3-6, with distinction to the fifth-order algorithm. It is also shown that modified odd-order schemes successfully avoid significant phase-speed errors and furnish results that are very close to that obtained with the next-higher even-order scheme but with a lower computational cost.},

PetClaw unifies two well-known scientific computing packages, Clawpack and PETSc, using Python interfaces into both. We rely on Clawpack to provide the infrastructure and kernels for time-dependent nonlinear wave propagation. Similarly, we rely on PETSc to manage distributed data arrays and the communication between them.We describe both the implementation and performance of PetClaw as well as our challenges and accomplishments in scaling a Python-based code to tens of thousands of cores on the BlueGene/P architecture. The capabilities of PetClaw are demonstrated through application to a novel problem involving elastic waves in a heterogeneous medium. Very finely resolved simulations are used to demonstrate the suppression of shock formation in this system.},

@article{Claeyman2010,
abstract = {This paper presents an evaluation of a new linear parameterization valid$\backslash$nfor the troposphere and the stratosphere, based on a first order$\backslash$napproximation of the carbon monoxide (CO) continuity equation. This$\backslash$nlinear scheme (hereinafter noted LINCO) has been implemented in the 3-D$\backslash$nChemical Transport Model (CTM) MOCAGE (MOdele de Chimie Atmospherique$\backslash$nGrande Echelle). First, a one and a half years of LINCO simulation has$\backslash$nbeen compared to output obtained from a detailed chemical scheme output.$\backslash$nThe mean differences between both schemes are about +/- 25 ppbv (part$\backslash$nper billion by volume) or 15\% in the troposphere and +/- 10 ppbv or$\backslash$n100\% in the stratosphere. Second, LINCO has been compared to diverse$\backslash$nobservations from satellite instruments covering the troposphere$\backslash$n(Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere: MOPITT) and the$\backslash$nstratosphere (Microwave Limb Sounder: MLS) and also from aircraft$\backslash$n(Measurements of ozone and water vapour by Airbus in-service aircraft:$\backslash$nMOZAIC programme) mostly flying in the upper troposphere and lower$\backslash$nstratosphere (UTLS). In the troposphere, the LINCO seasonal variations$\backslash$nas well as the vertical and horizontal distributions are quite close to$\backslash$nMOPITT CO observations. However, a bias of similar to -40 ppbv is$\backslash$nobserved at 700 hPa between LINCO and MOPITT. In the stratosphere, MLS$\backslash$nand LINCO present similar large-scale patterns, except over the poles$\backslash$nwhere the CO concentration is underestimated by the model. In the UTLS,$\backslash$nLINCO presents small biases less than 2\% compared to independent MOZAIC$\backslash$nprofiles. Third, we assimilated MOPITT CO using a variational 3D-FGAT$\backslash$n(First Guess at Appropriate Time) method in conjunction with MOCAGE for$\backslash$na long run of one and a half years. The data assimilation greatly$\backslash$nimproves the vertical CO distribution in the troposphere from 700 to 350$\backslash$nhPa compared to independent MOZAIC profiles. At 146 hPa, the assimilated$\backslash$nCO distribution is also improved compared to MLS observations by$\backslash$nreducing the bias up to a factor of 2 in the tropics. This study$\backslash$nconfirms that the linear scheme is able to simulate reasonably well the$\backslash$nCO distribution in the troposphere and in the lower stratosphere.$\backslash$nTherefore, the low computing cost of the linear scheme opens new$\backslash$nperspectives to make free runs and CO data assimilation runs at high$\backslash$nresolution and over periods of several years.},

@article{Guidi2005,
abstract = {Computer modeling through digital range images has been used for many applications, including 3D modeling of objects belonging to our cultural heritage. The scales involved range from small objects (e.g. pottery), to middle-sized works of art (statues, architectural decorations), up to very large structures (architectural and archaeological monuments). For any of these applications, suitable sensors and methodologies have been explored by different authors. The object to be modeled within this project is the Plastico di Roma antica, a large plaster-of-Paris model of imperial Rome (16x17 meters) created in the last century. Its overall size therefore demands an acquisition approach typical of large structures, but it also is characterized extremely tiny details typical of small objects (houses are a few centimeters high; their doors, windows, etc. are smaller than 1 centimeter). This paper gives an account of the procedures followed for solving this contradiction and describes how a huge 3D model was acquired and generated by using a special metrology Laser Radar. The procedures for reorienting in a single reference system the huge point clouds obtained after each acquisition phase, thanks to the measurement of fixed redundant references, are described. The data set was split in smaller sub-areas 2 x 2 meters each for purposes of mesh editing. This subdivision was necessary owing to the huge number of points in each individual scan (50-60 millions). The final merge of the edited parts made it possible to create a single mesh. All these processes were made with software specifically designed for this project since no commercial package could be found that was suitable for managing such a large number of points. Preliminary models are presented. Finally, the significance of the project is discussed in terms of the overall project known as Rome Reborn, of which the present acquisition is an important component.},

@article{Smolarkiewicz1992,
abstract = {Abstract This paper discusses a class of finite-difference approximations to the evolution equations of fluid dynamics. These approximations derive from elementary properties of differential forms. Values of a fluid variable $\psi$ at any two points of a space-time continuum are related through the integral of the space-time gradient of $\psi$ along an arbitrary contour connecting these two points (Stokes' theorem). Noting that spatial and temporal components of the gradient are related through the fluid equations, and selecting the contour composed of a parcel trajectory and an appropriate residual, leads to the integral form of the fluid equations, which is particularly convenient for finite-difference approximations. In these equations, the inertial and forcing terms are separated such that forces are integrated along a parcel trajectory (the Lagrangian aspect), whereas advection of the variable is evaluated along the residual contour (the Eulerian aspect). The virtue of this method is an extreme simplicity of t...},

@article{Kukkonen2012,
abstract = {Numerical models that combine weather forecasting and atmospheric chemistry are here referred to as chemical weather forecasting models. Eighteen operational chemical weather forecasting models on regional and continental scales in Europe are described and compared in this article. Topics discussed in this article include how weather forecasting and atmospheric chemistry models are integrated into chemical weather forecasting systems, how physical processes are incorporated into the models through parameterization schemes, how the model architecture affects the predicted variables, and how air chemistry and aerosol processes are formulated. In addition, we discuss sensitivity analysis and evaluation of the models, user operational requirements, such as model availability and documentation, and output availability and dissemination. In this manner, this article allows for the evaluation of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various modelling systems and modelling approaches. Finally, this article highlights the most prominent gaps of knowledge for chemical weather forecasting models and suggests potential priorities for future research directions, for the following selected focus areas: emission inventories, the integration of numerical weather prediction and atmospheric chemical transport models, boundary conditions and nesting of models, data assimilation of the various chemical species, improved understanding and parameterization of physical processes, better evaluation of models against data and the construction of model ensembles.},

@article{Prather2008,
abstract = {One expectation when computationally solving an Earth system model is that a correct answer exists, that with adequate physical approximations and numerical methods our solutions will converge to that single answer. With such hubris, we performed a controlled numerical test of the atmospheric transport of CO(2) using 2 models known for accurate transport of trace species. Resulting differences were unexpectedly large, indicating that in some cases, scientific conclusions may err because of lack of knowledge of the numerical errors in tracer transport models. By doubling the resolution, thereby reducing numerical error, both models show some convergence to the same answer. Now, under realistic conditions, we identify a practical approach for finding the correct answer and thus quantifying the advection error.},
